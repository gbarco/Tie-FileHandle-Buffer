NAME
    Tie::FileHandle::Split - Filehandle tie that captures, splits and stores
    output into files in a given path.

DESCRIPTION
    This module, when tied to a filehandle, will capture and store all that
    is output to that handle. You should then select a path to store files
    and a size to split files.

SYNOPSIS
    # $path should exist or the current process have # $size should be > 0
    tie *HANDLE, 'Tie::FileHandle::Split', $path, $size;

    (tied *HANDLE)->print( ' ' x 1024 );

    # write all outstanding output from buffers to files (tied
    *HANDLE)->write_buffers;

    # get generated filenames to the moment (tied *HANDLE)->get_filenames();

TODO
    *   write_buffers should sync to disk to ensure data has been written.

BUGS
    No known bugs. Please report.
